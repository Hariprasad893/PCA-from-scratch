# PCA-from-scratch
In this mini-project I tried to apply the mathematics behind PCA for dimensionally reducing the data.

The MNIST Handwritten digits data was taken for this mini-project, which was available on Kaggle. The data was preprocessed and all the necessary steps were performed to dimensionally reduce the data. For the sake of visualization, only the top two eigen vectors corresponding to the top two eigen values were taken for plotting.
